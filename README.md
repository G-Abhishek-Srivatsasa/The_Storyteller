# The_Storyteller
The project The_Storyteller is a simple use of the pyttsx3 and PyPDF2 modules . There is a pdf file called "story" which contains one random story from the internet. Upon running the code the speaker voice starts to read out the text inside the story.pdf  and we can also control the speed of the voice and the type of voice using .getProperty
